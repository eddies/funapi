	        <p>Subject to the terms and conditions of
	        this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
	        worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
	        copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,

			worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
			(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

			where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
			by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
			Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
			with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
			institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
			cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
			or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
			or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
			granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
			as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
	    </li>
	
	    <li>Redistribution.
			<p>You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
			Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
			modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
			meet the following conditions:</p>
	
			<ol id="license">
				<li>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a 
				copy of this License; and</li>
				
				<li>You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
	            stating that You changed the files; and</li>
				
				<li>You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
				that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
				attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
				the Derivative Works; and</li>
				
				<li>If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
				distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
				include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
				within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
				pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
				of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
				documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
				within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
				wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
				of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
				do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
				notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
				or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
				that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				as modifying the License.</li>
			</ol>
	    
			<p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
			may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
			for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
			for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
			reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
			the conditions stated in this License.</p>
	    </li>
	    
	    <li>Submission of Contributions.
	        <p>Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
			any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
			by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
			this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
			Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
			the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
			with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
	    </li>
	      
	    <li>Trademarks.
	        <p>This License does not grant permission to use the trade
			names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
			except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
			origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
	    </li>
	    
	    <li>Disclaimer of Warranty.
	        <p>Unless required by applicable law or
			agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
			Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
			WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
			implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
			of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
			PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
			appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
			risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
	    </li>
	    
	    <li>Limitation of Liability.
	        <p>In no event and under no legal theory,
			whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
			unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
			negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
			liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
			incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
			result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
			Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
			work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
			other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
			has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
		</li>
	      
	    <li>Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
	        <p>While redistributing
			the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
			and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
			or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
			License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
			on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
			of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
			defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
			incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
			of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
